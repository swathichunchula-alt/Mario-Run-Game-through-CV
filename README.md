# Mario-Run-Game-through-CV
🎮 Mario Run – Gesture-Controlled Game (CV) Mario Run is a computer vision–based game where the player controls Mario using hand gestures instead of a keyboard. The camera tracks hand movements in real time, and specific gestures are used to control actions like running or jumping, creating a fun, touch-free gaming experience.

🎮 Mario Run Game – Gesture-Controlled Using Computer Vision (Fully HTML-Based)


🔍 Project Overview

The Mario Run Gesture-Controlled Game is an interactive game where the player controls Mario using hand gestures instead of a keyboard or mouse. The system uses computer vision (CV) to track the player’s hand through the camera and translates specific movements into in-game actions such as running and jumping.

🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate gesture-based gaming using computer vision. It replaces traditional game controllers with real-time hand gestures, making gameplay more interactive, immersive, and touch-free. This project is also a strong learning platform for web-based computer vision and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts.

🧠 Core Working Principle

1️⃣ Camera Input

The browser accesses the device camera to capture live video.

The video feed is processed frame by frame using HTML and JavaScript.


2️⃣ Hand Detection & Tracking

The system detects and tracks the player’s hand continuously.

Hand position and motion are analyzed in real time.

No physical controller or keyboard input is needed.


3️⃣ Gesture Interpretation

Hand movements are interpreted as game commands:

Moving the hand → Mario runs

Raising the hand or making a jump gesture → Mario jumps

Gestures are mapped directly to in-game actions.


4️⃣ Game Control Mapping

Recognized gestures trigger corresponding game actions instantly.

The system ensures smooth gameplay by translating natural hand motions into real-time Mario movements.


🌐 HTML-Based Implementation

Entirely built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Runs directly in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

No installation required; only a webcam is needed.

Platform independent and lightweight.

Easily hosted online (e.g., GitHub Pages) for live demos.


▶️ Gameplay Experience

Player stands or sits in front of the camera.

Hand gestures are tracked and displayed on the screen.

Mario responds instantly to gestures for running and jumping.

The experience is touch-free, interactive, and fun.
